# mv-engineering-inductions
Induction and reference documents for the Makerversity London engineering workshops.

We have written these files as a reference for users of the Makerversity London engineering workshop. These are not intended as a replacement for the safety induction, but more as a reference for use later.

The files are written in LaTex. LaTex is a typesetting system that is normally used for scientific papers; it is an old-school way of generating documents but does not need anything more complex than a text editor to make changes. The team can then process the .tex file into a nicely formatted .pdf file.

(Adobe InDesign uses the LaTex typesetting engine so it really will be nicely formatted)
